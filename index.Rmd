# Preface

Hello! Welcome to the bookdown of our MATH 455 Mathematical Statistics project! Hope this is a good abstract of Jeffreys Prior for you.

We **are enjoying** knowing more about and communicating Jeffreys Prior. You are always welcome to come back to check our progress!

Here's a comic in recognition of Mathematical Statistics (especially null hypothesis).
